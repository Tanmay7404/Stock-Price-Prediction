# Stock-Price-Prediction

Built a basic model to predict price of a stock using its past historical data using linear regression.

Bulit a basic lstm model using log normalisation for more accurate prediction

Then added a variety of technical indicators like EMA, SMA, RSI, MACD. to the dataframe.

Consequently trained an LSTM network in the enhanced dataframe to improve the accuracy of predictions.
